# Project Overview

This repository contains the following files:

1. **Problem-1.py**  
    Description: Implement a class-based calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
    Create a class named Calculator.
    Define methods within the class for each operation: add, subtract, multiply, divide.
    Each method should accept two double-precision floating-point numbers as input (a and b).
    The operation type should be a string input indicating which operation to perform.
    Return the result of the calculation. Handle division by zero appropriately.

2. **Problem-2.py**  
    Description:  Generate a series of odd numbers up to a specified limit.
    Accept a single integer a as input.
    Generate a series of odd numbers starting from 1, incrementing by 2 in each step.
    Continue generating numbers until the number of generated odd numbers equals a.
    Output the generated series as a comma-separated string.

3. **Problem-3.py**  
    Description: Generate a series of odd numbers selectively based on the input.
    Accept a single integer a as input.
    If a is even, generate odd numbers until a/2 numbers is equal to x, then output series (1,3,5,7,9…)
    If a is odd, generate odd numbers until (a+1)/2 numbers is equal to x, then output series (1,3,5,7,9…)
    Output the generated series as a comma-separated string.


4. **Problem-4.py**  
    Description:  Count the number of elements in a list that are multiples of numbers from 1 to 9.
    Accept a list of integers as input.
    Create a dictionary with keys from 1 to 9.
    Iterate through the input list.
    For each number in the list, check if it is a multiple of each number from 1 to 9.
    If it is a multiple, increment the corresponding count in the dictionary.
    Output the dictionary.
